# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We are committed to making participation in the Arcane project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

This applies to both human contributors and AI agents collaborating on the project.

## Our Standards

**Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:**

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the project and community
- Showing empathy towards other community members
- Providing clear, actionable feedback in code reviews
- Documenting decisions and rationale for future contributors

**Examples of unacceptable behavior:**

- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information without permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate
- Deliberately sabotaging tests or CI/CD pipelines
- Submitting malicious code or dependencies

## Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for behaviors they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, including:
- GitHub repository (issues, PRs, discussions)
- Project documentation
- Community chat channels (if established)
- Project-related social media

It also applies when an individual is representing the project in public spaces.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at [INSERT EMAIL]. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All project team members are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org), version 2.1, available at https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct.html

## For AI Agents

AI agents are expected to:
- Follow the same standards as human contributors
- Not inject misleading comments or documentation
- Not introduce intentional bugs or vulnerabilities
- Clearly flag uncertainties rather than making assumptions
- Respect project conventions and design decisions

Violations by AI agents will be treated the same as violations by human contributors, with appropriate corrective action taken (which may include adjusting system prompts, changing tool access, or blocking access).
