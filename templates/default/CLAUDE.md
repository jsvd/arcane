# {{PROJECT_NAME}}

Read [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for the full guide on building this game with Arcane.

API declarations are in `types/*.d.ts` (one file per module: rendering, physics, game, ui, etc.). Start with [`types/cheatsheet.d.ts`](types/cheatsheet.d.ts) for a compact overview of every function. Use `/api` to look up specific functions.

**Essential topic guides** (read before coding): rendering, coordinates, tweening, particles, juice, transitions, input, entities. See the full list and genre-specific reading order in AGENTS.md.
