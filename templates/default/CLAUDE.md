Read [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for the full guide on building this game with Arcane.

API declarations are in `types/*.d.ts` (one file per module: rendering, physics, game, ui, etc.). Use `/api` to look up specific functions.

Topic guides in `docs/` cover specific systems in depth (coordinates, animation, physics, rendering).
