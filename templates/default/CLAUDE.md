Read [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for the full guide on building this game with Arcane.

API declarations are in `types/*.d.ts` (one file per module: rendering, physics, game, ui, etc.). These files include JSDoc, return types, and full signatures — read them directly. Use `/api` to look up specific functions, or ask `@arcane-api` for "how do I...?" questions, pattern recommendations, and choosing between APIs.

**Essential topic guides** (read before coding): rendering, coordinates, tweening, particles, juice, transitions, input, entities. See the full list and genre-specific reading order in AGENTS.md.

**Asset skills:** Use `/sprite` to find and setup sprite packs, `/sound` for audio. They search Asset Palace, download CC0 assets, and generate ready-to-use code.
